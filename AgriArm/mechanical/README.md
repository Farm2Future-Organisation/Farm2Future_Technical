# AgriArm – Mechanical Architecture

## Overview

AgriArm is a 6-DOF robotic arm constructed using a full metal structural framework designed for durability, precision, and educational deployment. The arm is built using 2mm thick aluminum plates, ensuring structural rigidity and long-term mechanical stability.

This version is optimized for:

- Agricultural automation prototyping
- Greenhouse task experimentation
- Robotics education and research
- DIY and maker-based development

---

## Mechanical Features

- **6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF)** for full 3D spatial movement
- Capable of:
  - Grasping
  - Lifting
  - Rotational manipulation
  - Multi-axis positioning
- Full metal chassis construction
- Modular servo mounting for easy replacement and upgrades

---

## Structural Material

- 2mm thick aluminum plates
- Reinforced joint brackets
- Metal gear compatible servo mounts
- Designed for stable torque transmission

---

## Servo Compatibility

AgriArm supports two primary servo models:

### 1. DS3115 (Digital Servo)

- Type: Digital
- Dead Time: 3µs (Faster response)
- Rotation Angle: 180° / 270°
- Higher torque output
- Enhanced precision
- Minimal backlash
- Accurate centering
- Better stability under load

---

### 2. MG996R (Analog Servo)

- Type: Analog
- Dead Time: 5µs
- Rotation Angle: 180°
- Metal gear steering mechanism
- Moderate torque output

---
